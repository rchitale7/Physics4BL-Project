Instructions for running note classification code:

1. Create a directory called sound_samples. (Path: Physics4BL-Project/sound_samples)
2. Unzip each instrument zip file, move the created directory to the sound_samples folder. 
3. note_classification/note_classification_code.py will then read .wav files from sound_samples directory. (e.g. to read a trumpet sound file, we would read from the path: Physics4BL-Project/sound_samples/trumpet/{name of trumpet file}.wav)
